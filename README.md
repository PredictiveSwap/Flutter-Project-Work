To run the application, extract the compressed file and open it using Visual Studio Code (Recommended) or you can use Android Studio as well (make sure Flutter plugin is installed.)

You should do a pubspec run to get all the dependecy installed (though no particular dependency is appled!).

Make sure all the imports are done properly, if there is any directory change please ensure the imports are refactored.

Ope the lib folder and then the main.dart file and choose an emulator or simulator to open and run the file. This should install the app in the device. The same can be done with your physical device.

DESIGN CHOICES
Approached a minimalistic design. Made use of the concept of Stateful and Statless Widget.

PROBLEMS FACED
Trying to implement a "Press Enter To Activate the Button" but couldn't implement.
